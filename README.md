An implementation of projecteuler.net problems in Ruby.

In order to learn Ruby and knock the cobwebs off my math skills, I am attempting the problems on projecteuler.net using Ruby. 

My personal workflow looks something like this:
1) Implement a solution using only what I currently know in my Ruby and math toolbox.
2) Do some research and generally rediscover a better mathematical formula or algorithm (like a better formula for triangle numbers, finding the nth prime number, etc.)
3) Implement a better solution using better mathematics and/or "the Ruby way".

For instance, for the "find the Nth prime number":
1) Implement a naive version of what I think is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2) Check out the wikipedia article and learn a much better implementation.
3a) Implement a new version of the solution using this new method. 
3b) Research a "prime" lib available in Ruby, learn it and use it instead.
